# Disable The Official League Of Legends Presence

## Summary
League-RPC-Disabler is a Windows application designed to disable the official League of Legends Rich Presence.

This application detects the launch of League of Legends. Upon detection, it modifies a specific JSON configuration file to disable the discord plugin.
This is something users want to do, especially when running different league-RPC programs, like: [league-rpc-linux](https://github.com/its-haze/league-rpc-linux)

You could do all of this manually, but you would have to do it everytime you open league...
So having this in the background just saves a couple of minutes for you.

To do this manually, you would first need to find your plugin-manifest.json file.. usually it's in this location
```
C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Plugins\plugin-manifest.json
```
and remove this entry:

```json
{
    "as": [],
    "name": "rcp-be-lol-discord-rp",
    "affinity": null,
    "lazy": false
}
```
Basically, all this program does, is to automate this process.
